## **Supervised Learning in AI**  

### **What is Supervised Learning?**  
Supervised Learning is a type of **Machine Learning (ML)** where an AI model is trained using **labeled data**. This means the dataset contains **input features (X)** and their corresponding **correct outputs (Y)**. The goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs so it can make accurate predictions on **new, unseen data**.

## **1. Why is it Called "Supervised"?**  
It is called **supervised learning** because the model learns under supervision, just like a student learning with an answer key. The model is given **input-output pairs** and adjusts itself to minimize errors.

## **2. Types of Supervised Learning**
Supervised Learning is divided into two main categories:  

### **A. Regression** (Predicting Continuous Values)  
Regression models predict **numerical values** (e.g., predicting stock prices, house prices, temperature).  
ðŸ“Œ **Example**: Predicting a personâ€™s **salary** based on **years of experience**.  
- **Input (X)**: Years of experience  
- **Output (Y)**: Salary  
- **Algorithm used**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks  

### **B. Classification** (Predicting Categories)  
Classification models predict **categories** (e.g., spam or not spam, loan approved or not).  
ðŸ“Œ **Example**: Detecting whether an email is **spam or not**.  
- **Input (X)**: Email content  
- **Output (Y)**: Spam (1) or Not Spam (0)  
- **Algorithm used**: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Neural Networks

## **3. How Supervised Learning Works?**
The process involves **three main steps**:

### **Step 1: Training the Model**
- The algorithm is given a **training dataset** with labeled inputs and outputs.
- The model **learns the patterns** and adjusts its internal parameters.

### **Step 2: Model Evaluation**
- After training, the model is tested on a **separate test dataset** (new unseen data).
- The performance is measured using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, etc.**

### **Step 3: Making Predictions**
- Once trained and evaluated, the model can now **predict outputs** for new inputs.

## **4. Example of Supervised Learning**
### **Example: Predicting House Prices**
You have data on **houses** and their **prices**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Dataset** (Labeled Data):  
| Area (sq. ft) | Bedrooms | Age (years) | Price (INR) |
|--------------|---------|-----------|------------|
| 1200        | 2       | 5         | 50,00,000  |
| 1500        | 3       | 10        | 65,00,000  |
| 1800        | 3       | 2         | 80,00,000  |

ðŸ“Œ **How it works?**  
1. **Training**: The model learns from past data.  
2. **New Input**: Suppose a house has **1600 sq. ft, 3 bedrooms, 5 years old**.  
3. **Prediction**: The model predicts its price as **â‚¹72,00,000**.

## **5. Common Supervised Learning Algorithms**
| Algorithm | Used for | Example Applications |
|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| **Linear Regression** | Regression | Predicting house prices |
| **Logistic Regression** | Classification | Spam detection |
| **Decision Trees** | Both | Loan approval, fraud detection |
| **Random Forest** | Both | Customer churn prediction |
| **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** | Classification | Face recognition |
| **Neural Networks** | Both | Image and speech recognition |
