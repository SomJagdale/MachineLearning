# MachineLearning

## **Supervised Learning in AI**  

### **What is Supervised Learning?**  
Supervised Learning is a type of **Machine Learning (ML)** where an AI model is trained using **labeled data**. This means the dataset contains **input features (X)** and their corresponding **correct outputs (Y)**. The goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs so it can make accurate predictions on **new, unseen data**.

---

## **1. Why is it Called "Supervised"?**  
It is called **supervised learning** because the model learns under supervision, just like a student learning with an answer key. The model is given **input-output pairs** and adjusts itself to minimize errors.

---

## **2. Types of Supervised Learning**
Supervised Learning is divided into two main categories:  

### **A. Regression** (Predicting Continuous Values)  
Regression models predict **numerical values** (e.g., predicting stock prices, house prices, temperature).  
📌 **Example**: Predicting a person’s **salary** based on **years of experience**.  
- **Input (X)**: Years of experience  
- **Output (Y)**: Salary  
- **Algorithm used**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks  

### **B. Classification** (Predicting Categories)  
Classification models predict **categories** (e.g., spam or not spam, loan approved or not).  
📌 **Example**: Detecting whether an email is **spam or not**.  
- **Input (X)**: Email content  
- **Output (Y)**: Spam (1) or Not Spam (0)  
- **Algorithm used**: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Neural Networks  

---

## **3. How Supervised Learning Works?**
The process involves **three main steps**:

### **Step 1: Training the Model**
- The algorithm is given a **training dataset** with labeled inputs and outputs.
- The model **learns the patterns** and adjusts its internal parameters.

### **Step 2: Model Evaluation**
- After training, the model is tested on a **separate test dataset** (new unseen data).
- The performance is measured using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, etc.**

### **Step 3: Making Predictions**
- Once trained and evaluated, the model can now **predict outputs** for new inputs.

## **4. Example of Supervised Learning**
### **Example: Predicting House Prices**
You have data on **houses** and their **prices**.  

📌 **Dataset** (Labeled Data):  
| Area (sq. ft) | Bedrooms | Age (years) | Price (INR) |
|--------------|---------|-----------|------------|
| 1200        | 2       | 5         | 50,00,000  |
| 1500        | 3       | 10        | 65,00,000  |
| 1800        | 3       | 2         | 80,00,000  |

📌 **How it works?**  
1. **Training**: The model learns from past data.  
2. **New Input**: Suppose a house has **1600 sq. ft, 3 bedrooms, 5 years old**.  
3. **Prediction**: The model predicts its price as **₹72,00,000**.

## **Linear Regression: The Basics & Beyond**  

### **What is Linear Regression?**  
Linear Regression is a **Supervised Learning algorithm** used for **predicting continuous values**. It establishes a linear relationship between **input features (X)** and **output (Y)** using a straight-line equation.

👉 In simple terms, **Linear Regression** finds the **best-fit line** that predicts the output (Y) based on input (X).

---

## **1. Why is it Called "Linear"?**  
It’s called **Linear Regression** because it assumes that the relationship between **input (X) and output (Y) is linear** (i.e., a straight-line relationship).

For example:  
📌 **Predicting House Prices**  
- **X (Input):** Area of the house (in sq. ft)  
- **Y (Output):** Price of the house (in INR)  
- The larger the area, the higher the price → **Linear Relationship**

### **Mathematical Representation**  
The equation of a straight line is:  
\[
Y = mX + c
\]  
Where:  
- \( Y \) → Predicted output (dependent variable)  
- \( X \) → Input feature (independent variable)  
- \( m \) → Slope (how much Y changes when X increases)  
- \( c \) → Intercept (the value of Y when X = 0)  

In **Machine Learning**, we generalize it as:  
\[
Y = \theta_0 + \theta_1 X
\]  
Where:  
- \( \theta_0 \) (Intercept) = \( c \)  
- \( \theta_1 \) (Slope) = \( m \)  
- \( X \) is the input feature

## **2. Example: Predicting House Prices**
Let's say we collect data on houses:

| **Area (sq. ft)** | **Price (INR in Lakhs)** |
|-----------------|------------------|
| 1000           | 50               |
| 1500           | 70               |
| 2000           | 90               |
| 2500           | 110              |

We plot this on a graph and try to find the **best-fit line** that minimizes error.

👉 If the equation of the line is:  
\[
\text{Price} = 20 + 0.04 \times \text{Area}
\]  
Then for **1800 sq. ft**, the predicted price is:  
\[
\text{Price} = 20 + 0.04 \times 1800 = 92 \text{ Lakhs}
\]

---

## **3. Cost Function: How to Measure Error?**  
The best-fit line is found by **minimizing the error** between predicted values and actual values.  

The **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is used as the cost function:

\[
J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y_i})^2
\]

Where:  
- \( Y_i \) → Actual value  
- \( \hat{Y_i} \) → Predicted value  
- \( n \) → Total number of data points  

👉 The smaller the error, the better the model!

---

## **4. How Does the Model Learn? (Gradient Descent)**
The model needs to **find the best values of \( \theta_0 \) and \( \theta_1 \)**.  
It does this using an optimization algorithm called **Gradient Descent**.

**Gradient Descent Steps:**
1. Start with random values of \( \theta_0 \) and \( \theta_1 \).
2. Compute the cost function (error).
3. Adjust \( \theta_0 \) and \( \theta_1 \) to minimize the error.
4. Repeat until error is minimized.

**Gradient Descent Formula:**  
\[
\theta_j = \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_j}
\]
Where:  
- \( \alpha \) → Learning rate (small step size to update weights)  
- \( \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_j} \) → Partial derivative of the cost function  

👉 This process keeps adjusting \( \theta \) values until we find the best-fit line!

## **5. Types of Linear Regression**  

### **A. Simple Linear Regression** (One Feature)  
- Uses only **one independent variable (X)**.  
- Example: Predicting salary based on **years of experience**.  

### **B. Multiple Linear Regression** (Multiple Features)  
- Uses **more than one independent variable (X1, X2, ... Xn)**.  
- Example: Predicting house price using **area, number of bedrooms, location, etc.**  

**Formula for Multiple Regression:**  
\[
Y = \theta_0 + \theta_1X_1 + \theta_2X_2 + ... + \theta_nX_n
\]

---

## **6. When to Use Linear Regression?**
✅ When the relationship between X and Y is **linear**.  
✅ When data is **not too complex**.  
✅ When interpretability is important (knowing how features affect the outcome).  

🚫 **Avoid Linear Regression when:**  
❌ The relationship between X and Y is **not linear**.  
❌ There are **outliers** (extreme values that distort predictions).  
❌ The dataset is too **small or biased**.
