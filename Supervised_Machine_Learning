Welcome to the Machine Learning Specialization! You're joining millions of others who have taken either this or the original course, which led to the founding of Coursera, and has helped millions of other learners, like you, take a look at the exciting world of machine learning!
Learning Objectives
Define machine learning
Define supervised learning
Define unsupervised learning
Write and run Python code in Jupyter Notebooks
Define a regression model
Implement and visualize a cost function
Implement gradient descent
Optimize a regression model using gradient descent


This week, you'll extend linear regression to handle multiple input features. You'll also learn some methods for improving your model's training and performance, such as vectorization, feature scaling, feature engineering and polynomial regression. At the end of the week, you'll get to practice implementing linear regression in code.
Learning Objectives
Use vectorization to implement multiple linear regression
Use feature scaling, feature engineering, and polynomial regression to improve model training
Implement linear regression in code



This week, you'll learn the other type of supervised learning, classification. You'll learn how to predict categories using the logistic regression model. You'll learn about the problem of overfitting, and how to handle this problem with a method called regularization. You'll get to practice implementing logistic regression with regularization at the end of this week!
Learning Objectives
Use logistic regression for binary classification
Implement logistic regression for binary classification
Address overfitting using regularization, to improve model performance
