This week, you will learn two key unsupervised learning algorithms: clustering and anomaly detection
Learning Objectives
Implement the k-means clustering algorithm
Implement the k-means optimization objective
Initialize the k-means algorithm
Choose the number of clusters for the k-means algorithm
Implement an anomaly detection system
Decide when to use supervised learning vs. anomaly detection
Implement the centroid update function in k-means
Implement the function that finds the closest centroids to each point in k-means



Learning Objectives
Implement collaborative filtering recommender systems in TensorFlow
Implement deep learning content based filtering using a neural network in TensorFlow
Understand ethical considerations in building recommender systems



This week, you will learn about reinforcement learning, and build a deep Q-learning neural network in order to land a virtual lunar lander on Mars!
Learning Objectives
Understand key terms such as return, state, action, and policy as it applies to reinforcement learning
Understand the Bellman equations
Understand the state-action value function
Understand continuous state spaces
Build a deep Q-learning network
